# HW2_Comminuty_Multiplayer_Mod

This repo was imported from Bitbucket.org when I erased my account

It is a mod for the 2003 hit videogame "Homeworld 2".
In 201X the rights to the game were sold to Gearbox, who in 201[4|5] released Homeworld Remastered (HWRM) 
As far as I know this mod is NOT compatible with HWRM, please feel free to try though.

To anyone who is not a crazy Homeworld fan please **ignore this repo completely.**
It is not a good example of anything including but not limited to: Good Programming practice, how to write LUA, how to make games, my real programing abilities, or how to structure git repos. 
**This is just an old abandoned project, that I keep for sentimental reasons.** This is the one where I met the woman im going to marry ( <3 ). 
Sorry that's not really apropriate for a readme.
